A terminal-based graphing calculator, written in Node.js and implemented using my [parsemath](/project/parsemath) algorithm.

It allows up to four graphs to be plot on the screen at once, as well as allowing graphs to be stretched and translated on the screen using the keyboard.

I implemented a multi-page user interface using only fundamental standard stream operations, such as writing text to the standard output.
